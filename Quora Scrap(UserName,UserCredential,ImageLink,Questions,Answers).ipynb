When one of those trillions of cells, which has taken a billion year journey, gets it wrong, it is called cancer. The fact that cancer is so rare is astonishing. Eating healthily helps, but only a little. The best way to not get cancer is to not be old (because then the cells have been dividing for less time, and are less likely to screw it up). \n",
